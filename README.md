Make sure you have openjdk-17 (munimun) installed.

This project has 1 package.

In "src/test/resources/features/mytest.feature" do you find one user 
history and four test cases in Gherkin language.

I recommend you read them.

To run the test cases for this user story, open the terminal bash.

Run the following command:

```
./gradlew clean test aggregate
```

or at terminal powershell:

```
gradlew clean test aggregate
```

Watch the execution and in the end find the report in next project path:

and open in web browser.

You can watch all tests passed.  ✅✅✅✅
